# `cid`

**`cid`** ("content id") is a _human-friendly_
unique ID function built for use with mobile-first/distributed apps.

<!-- add link to example of single-server setup using cid!
> **Note**: `cid` can also/easily be used for centralised apps
which do not require offline/client support.  
-->

# Why?

We needed a way of running our App(s) across multiple servers/devices
without fear/risk of collisions in the IDs of records.

The goal is to allow records to be created _offline_ (_e.g: on a mobile device_)
with the ID generated on the _client_ and when the record is synched/saved
to the server (database) it can be _verified_
and the ID does not need to change.
Furthermore because the ID is based

We _could_ have used "_Ye olde_" **UUID** (_random/nondeterministic_)
as the IDs and achieve the desired collision-avoidance,
but we felt we could do _much_ better
and allow us to build a "checksum" mechanism
into our app that will _verify_ records created by any device
to allow an _effortless_ distributed/decentralised system.

This may all sound "esoteric" if you have not yet built
an "offline-first" application. Our hope is that this `README.md`
will _clarify_ our _reasoning_ for "_reinventing the wheel_".

## Context

In a "basic" Relational Database
(e.g: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, etc.)
the default way of identifying records
is using an auto-incrementing integer: 1, 2, 3, etc.
This is the _optimal_ way of referencing records
in a _single_ (database) server setup
where the counter
for the number of records
in a given table
only needs to be known by one machine
and there is no chance of conflict.
e.g. if there are currently 100 blog posts in the database,
the server will assign the _next_ blog post the id **101**;
there is no chance that it will create a `new` post with id **99**
which would conflict with the post you wrote yesterday.


## Centralised = _Single_ Point of _Failure_

As users of software or beginners _building_ apps,
we don't often think about _failure_.
The _reality_ however, is that systems fail _all-the-time_.
All the most popular systems/services fail even Google
who have _thousands_ of world-class engineers dedicated
to keeping the system up.

Most Apps are designed to be centralised
because it's _much_ easier to get started
and for the most part there won't be any issues.

The problem comes when something in the system (_e.g: the database_) _fails_.

![centralised-vs-distributed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/49139062-bd79a300-f2e8-11e8-9041-ab5c1b98ee86.png "centralised versus distributed networks")

If the _single_ databases server handling all the requests
fails, _all_ users are affected by the outage
for as long as it takes the team to revive it.

> Having witnessed ***Distributed Denial of Service*** ("DDoS") attacks
_first-hand_, we have _experienced_ the pain of having to recover
crashed servers with corrupted mission-critical customer data; it's bleak.
Yes, there are services like
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos)
or
[Imperva](https://www.incapsula.com/ddos-protection-services.html)
which promise to _mitigate_ against DDoS attacks,
however the _reality_ is that they are only providing "frontend" protection;
if for _any_ reason your _single-server_ database was to _crash_,
your app will still be out-of-action regardless of having CloudFlare.


## Why _Decentralise_?

If you have _never_ had the experience of being _offline_
or the service you are using being interrupted,
then you either live in hyper-connected Paolo Alto
(_with backup/redundant networks and city-wide WiFi_)
or simply don't _use_ the Internet "_enough_" to notice the outages.

All the work we do depends on having access to the Internet.
We need to _systematically_ `reduce` that dependency.

Network and hardware ***fault-tolerance*** is ***essential***
for many apps and enables a whole _new_ "class" of apps to be created.

Specifically applications that are "federated".
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_architecture

The Apps that we (@dwyl) are creating
_must_ be decentralised;
there _cannot_ be a single point of failure.

Decentralisation is not just "_philosophical_" argument,
as creative technologists we are _directly_ responsible
for the technology we create.
The lives of _billions_ of people are at stake
if we continue to _allow_ the centralised _control_
of our communication networks.

If you believe in
the universal human right to
[privacy](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights)
[Article 12]
_freedom_ from oppression
and the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule),
then _logically_ this is the _only_ thing to do.



# Who?

Anyone who is techno-curious about the future of the Internet
and wants to _understand_ the way decentralised applications
derive the IDs for content.

We feel that _most_ apps can benefit
from being decentralised/distributed by `default`
because it means they work "***offline***" when any element fails
and data can easily be "synched" (_and verified_)
when connection is re-established.

If you want to build a
**mobile/offline-first _progressive_ mobile web app** (PWA)
that **feels _native_** on both Android and iOS,
then _understanding_ CIDs is a good place to start.

> If you are building apps that will use a _single_ database instance
for whatever reason (_e.g: they aren't very "complex"
or don't need to be distributed or work offline-first_)
keep enjoying the simplicity and maybe come back to this
later when you feel you _need_ this functionality.


# What?

In a distributed database, we need a way of creating IDs
for the records without any risk of "collision".
We _also_ need a _consistent_ way of creating IDs both on the server
and on the client (_to allow for offline-first distributed apps_).

### Why _Not_ Use UUIDs?

There are _many_ ways of creating unique IDs,
the most popular has historically been UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier

A UUID is a 128-bit number usually represented as base16 (_hexadecimal_)
for example:
```
85594564-5be7-465f-b007-0fada384ed44
```
(via https://www.uuidgenerator.net )

Consider the following URL
(_featuring a **UUID** as the `id` of a record_):

location-app.com/venues/85594564-5be7-465f-b007-0fada384ed44

It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. ðŸ™„

append-only log.

One of our ... readable/typeable[<sup>1</sup>](#notes)




```
123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyz
```
With a **56** characters in the set,
we can create IDs of the following lengths:<br />
+ 2: **56^2** = 3,136
+ 3: **56^3** = 175,616
+ 4: **56^4** = 9,834,496
+ 5: **56^5** = 550,731,776
...
+ 22:

Crucially, we can create a system where the IDs start out at 2 characters
and increase gradually as required
(_similar to how Instagram grew their IDs as they scaled, see below_).


# How?


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cid` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cid, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Right now there are only two use cases for `cid` generation
which are inline with what we need for our _current_ App/project:

### `cid` from a `String`

Given that under-the-hood `cid` is "_just_" using SHA512 hash,
the _output_ will _always_ be the same. It's simple, that's the point.

```
require Cid

Cid.make("hello world") # > "MJ7MSJwS1utMxA9QyQLytNDtd5RGnx6m" (always!)
```

A real world use case for
wanting a `cid` based on a `String`
is a URL shortener.
For example you have a long URL:
https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-ecto-append-only-log-example
the `cid` of this url is:

```
require Cid

Cid.make("https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-ecto-append-only-log-example") # > "gVSTedHFGBetxyYib9mBQsjtZj4dJjQe"
```

We can then create a URLs table
in our URL shortening app/service
with the following entry:

| `inserted_at ` | **`URL`** (PK) | `cid` | `short` |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1541609554 | https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-ecto-append-only-log-example | gVSTedHFGBetxyYib9mBQsjtZj4dJjQe | gV |

So the "short" url would be
[dwyl.co/gV](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-ecto-append-only-log-example)

This is a relatively "boring" but still perfect _valid_ use case.
If someone attempts to create a short URL for this (_same_) _long_ URL,
the URL shortening app will simply return
[dwyl.co/gV](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-ecto-append-only-log-example)
the _same_ short URL each time.

The _reason_ we can abbreviate the URL to just `gV`
is because our SHORT URL service has a _centralised_ Database/store.
If we wanted to run a _decentralised_ content addressing system,
we would simply link to the _full_ `cid`:
[dwyl.co/gVSTedHFGBetxyYib9mBQsjtZj4dJjQe](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-ecto-append-only-log-example)

Where the chance of `cid` collision
is less than 1 in "the number of
atoms in the Universe".
If we generated 1 Billion CIDs per _second_
for the next Trillion years there would
still be less than a **0.001%** chance of collision.<sup>3</sup>



### `cid` from a `Map`

## Real World Examples

There are _many_ Apps and Services that use Strings as IDs instead of Integers.

### Google URL Shortener

While the
[Google URL Shortener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_URL_Shortener)
https://goo.gl
has recently been discontinued<sup>2</sup>,
you are likely to continue seeing it's short links
around the web for the foreseeable future
and it still serves as an insightful case study.

The https://goo.gl service is a basic URL shortener
that allows people (_registered Google users_)
to paste links into an input field
and when the "SHORTEN URL" (_shouty_) button is clicked/tapped,
a much shorter URL is created:

![googl-url-shortner-form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/49341817-b5a06280-f64a-11e8-9db2-db0e81661679.png)

e.g: https://goo.gl/nKXAdA

When Google announced they were shutting down the service (_for new links_),
I downloaded the CSV of the links I created for _one_ of my accounts:

![googl-url-shor-links](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/47958195-6ec53b80-dfbe-11e8-84d1-3269f6d2aba7.png)

Notice how the IDs are all **6 alphanumeric characters**?
The "character set" is:
```sh
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
I've never seen a goo.gl short URL with a special character. <br />
But since it's a closed-source product, there's no way of knowing for sure.

With a 63 character set, and an ID length of 6,
there are **63^6** = 62,523,502,209 **62.5 Billion IDs**. <br />
It was _unlikely_ Google was going to "run out" of IDs,
they must have decided to shut down the service
because it was being used for "SPAM" and "PHISHING" ...
e.g: https://lifehacker.com/5708311/new-virus-watch-out-for-googl-links-on-twitter

People with unethical motives is reason
[_why we can't have "nice things"_!](https://youtu.be/2oBPK_iqBZc)

#### Learning Point

If you have a simple Blog or Site with a few thousand links,
you can _easily_ use short URLs with **3 characters**.
**63^3** = 250,047 **250K IDs** is _enough_ for even a _popular_ blog!
and **63^4** = 15,752,961 **15.7 Million IDs**
is plenty for the first few years of a link sharing service!

We will be integrating this knowledge into our App.

### Instagram's (_Apparently_) Random String IDs

From the start Instagram got _several_ things "right" in
both their iOS App, their backend App/API design and infrastructure choices.
We will be producing a _separate_ "case study" on Instragram
in the _near_ future, meanwhile let's focus on one thing: the post IDs.

The **_first_ image** posted on Instagram (16th July 2010)
was by
[Kevin Systrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Systrom).
It features a dog in Mexico near a taco stand,
with a guest appearance by his girlfriendâ€™s foot wearing a flip-flop:
https://www.instagram.com/p/C/
![first-instagram-post](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/49203797-7e5b5880-f3a1-11e8-9c7c-c85ee9622994.png)

> In many ways this image is _representative_ of the social network as a whole,
it uses the "**X-PRO2**" filter and is _totally insignificant_ to _most_
of the **99,704 people** who "**liked**" it, unless these almost 100K people
are general "dog-lovers" who "like" _all/any_ dogs ... ðŸ’­


Notice how the URL of this image is `/p/C/`? <br />
The `/p/` part refers to the
"posts controller" in the
(_[Django](https://quora.com/What-programming-languages-are-used-at-Instagram)
-based_) Web App. <br />
The `C` is the the `ID` of the post. Yes, `String` is used for "ID"!
[Mike Krieger](https://firstround.com/review/how-instagram-co-founder-mike-krieger-took-its-engineering-org-from-0-to-300-people)
chose to use a **`String`** for the Post IDs
(_rather than an_ `Auto-incrementing Integer`)
for _three_ simple reasons:  <br />
1. Strings can be shorter than Ints because the character set is larger.
if the character set is just numeric digits `0123456789` then
the number of potential IDs or "posts" corresponds to the length of the ID.
There are only **9999** potential **IDs** if the ID length is 4 characters
(10^4 = 10k, subtract the 0000 ID which would never be used
  in an auto-incrementing database that starts at 1)
2. Strings **_obscure_ how many posts** have been made on the network
(_whereas an **Int** would make it
  **immediately obvious** how **popular** the network was!_)
3. Strings make it more difficult to **guess** the ID of the next post
"scrape" the site's content. This is also _good_ for privacy again because
nobody can _guess_ a _private_ Post's ID.

Sure enough, the **_second_ post** on Instagram is:
https://www.instagram.com/p/D/
![tacos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/49208839-c6ce4280-f3b0-11e8-9c45-eb10f0c424f9.png)
**24,402 likes** ... seems legit.
everyone is entitled to their own "taste" in what content to "like".

If we keep going through the alphabet we soon discover that ID `F`
does not exist:
https://www.instagram.com/p/F/
![instagram-F-does-not-exist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/49223657-3fe09080-f3d7-11e8-9616-8d1f4edfe56b.png)

This could either be because it was never assigned
(_the system skipped this ID_) or because it was deleted.


By December of 2010 Instagram was claiming to have **1 Million Users**:
https://www.instagram.com/p/pLY-/
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/49203915-e873fd80-f3a1-11e8-83de-5fbc3b0ef002.png)
> And while we have no reason to _doubt_ their claim,
there is an _obvious_ incentive for any venture-backed startup to
[overstate metrics](https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/23/facebook-apologizes-for-error-in-overstating-video-views/)
in order to _fuel_ adoption and secure more funding.<br />
It's certainly _interesting_ that a photo of a random Taco stand
gets [**24k**](https://youtu.be/UqyT8IEBkvY) "likes"
but the _milestone_ announcement
that there are now 1 Million Users on the app
gets only **390**;
you would think people in the early insta-community would have been more
excited about this ...? Anyway, back to the IDs!

At the point where they passed 1 Million Users,
the post IDs where **4 characters** in length: **`pLY-`**
This means there was an "address space" big enough for almost 19M photos
(_see below_) an average of 19 posts per user.

This **`pLY-`** post ID gives us quite a lot more information.
**`pLY-`** indicates that the IDs are both `UPPERCASE` and `lowercase`
letters of the alphabet (`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`)
and URL-safe characters; in this case a _hyphen_.

A more recent post on Instagram has an ID of **`BqHTJ9WHptI`**
(_11 characters_):
https://www.instagram.com/p/BqHTJ9WHptI
![instagram-record-id](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/49209240-e023be80-f3b1-11e8-9282-5e1c4a80e1bd.png)

The **`BqHTJ9WHptI`** post ID tells us
that they are also using _Numeric_ characters
(`0123456789`).

So we know they are using a URL-safe human-readable character set
which _almost_ matches **Base64**:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Base64_table <br />

![base64-character-set](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/49223407-9bf6e500-f3d6-11e8-8241-84fdc924c64d.png)

The key distinction between the Instagram ID charset and Base64,
is that Base64 allows the _forward slash_ (`/`) and _plus_ (`+`) characters
which are both reserved characters in URLs.
Which makes us think that Instagram's IDs are more along the lines of
[RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt):
```sh
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz-~.
```
**66 characters**.

With a 66 character set and 4 charter ID length
there are **66^4** = **18,974,736** IDs.

With an ID length of **11**
(_as is the case in the most recent insta posts_), <br />
the _potential_ number of IDs is **66^11** = **103,510,234,140,112,521,216** ...
**103 _Quintillion_**. <br />
Enough for _each_ of the Earth's 7.5 Billion people
to post **14 Billion images**.

It appears that Instagram have ~~inflated~~ raised their ID length in order to
achieve objectives 2 and 3 (_described above_),
they don't want anyone to know how much
activity there _really_ is on the network.

Instagram are using a distributed system for creating their post IDs.
